Group 3 Project MovieMaster

Project Description: 
MovieMaster is a centralized platform for movie lovers who want a one-stop-shop for finding their next Movie. This website pulls ratings and reviews from credible movie review pages such as IMDb, TMDB, and MetaCritic. It allows users to add ratings, reviews, “Like” movies, and use our ingenious proprietary features. Users must register an account and log in to gain access to our suite of innovative features. For instance, the “For You” page uses “Liked movies'' to compute movie suggestions using MovieMaster’s state-of-the-art Recommendation Model. Making recommendations tailored to a user’s individual tastes was a core goal for the MovieMaster website. The “Flix” Page allows MovieMaster users to watch an uninterrupted stream of hot movie trailers with friends and family, to help decide what movie to watch together. This feature was inspired by popular platforms such as Tik Tok, Instagram Reels, and Youtube Shorts. We wanted to deliver an addictive scrolling experience unique to MovieMaster through the “Flix” page. We believe this strategy will help garner a younger audience who is fond of the “scrolling” media consumption format. Our overall mission with MovieMaster is to provide movie buffs with one single platform to search for, review, discover, and rate movies with their friends and family on a movie night.
